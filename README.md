# FBI Crime Analysis

Welcome To our project!

In this project we took data from the UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting) and cleaned it to fit it for our analysis. We proceeded to create visualizations to compared crimes in different states and there is a section on machine learning that predicts future crime rates! The last step was to deploy our application into Heroku.
